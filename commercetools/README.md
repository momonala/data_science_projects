# Commercetools Data Scientist Interview

Coding interview challenge for a data scientist position at commercetools, an ecommerce company. I performed exploratory data analysis, built a recommendation engine for products using singular value decomposition, and built a visualization tool for the results in Flask. 

`explore.ipynb` contains the exploratory analysis, and [app](app/) containts the Flask files.
