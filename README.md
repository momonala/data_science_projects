# Machine Learning Projects 

Various smaller projects in machine learning and data science. 

[Data Talks - Twitter Analysis](DataTalks_Twitter/)

Twitter Analysis for Data Talks with Nate. Decision tree visualization and LSTM for fake tweets. 

[US Visas Data Science](USVisas_bigData_project/)

Research on US Visa application approval rates and factors for my big data course at Twente. 

[Commercetools Data Scientist Interview](commercetools/)

Coding interview challenge for a data scientist position at commercetools, an ecommerce company. I performed exploratory data analysis, built a recommendation engine for products using singular value decomposition, and built a visualization tool for the results in Flask. 

[Time Series Analysis](timeseries/)

This is an assigment from my MS course at the University of Twente on Time Series analysis and various methods and algorthms you can use for working with time series data. Specfically, I cover fourier transform, generating features, peak detection, bandpass filtering, K-nearest-neigbors with dynamic time warping, and seasonality detrending. Data sources are: [Activity Recognition data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from UC Irvine using inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope). It has both raw data and common derived features. For time series prediction, I use the [Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) from Kaggle. You can find the questions and answers in the pdf in the time series directory. 

Additional dependencies include: [Dynamic  Time Warping lib by lukauskas](https://github.com/lukauskas/dtwco)
